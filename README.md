# Calibration Box

_Sometimes, you just need a box._

## Notes
First off, this is 100% taken from Unity3D's own calibration scene, i've just stripped out all of the other scene junk and whittled it down to just the box.

## How to use
Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Harry-Harrison/calibration-box/releases/latest) and import it into your Unity3D project. From there you just need to drag the *Calibration Box* prefab out of the Project tab and into your Hierachy or Scene view.
